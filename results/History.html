Asia-Pacific in Global History: From 1800 examines major themes which inform the
study of world history following the start of the 19th century, particularly in two related
areas: trade and migration against the backdrop of colonialism, imperialism and nationbuilding.
The study of global history from an Asia-Pacific perspective looks at the history
of globalization which is not strictly defined in economic terms, but is informed by
themes, such as migration, environment, imperialism, biological exchange, etc. Even
though the year chosen is 1800, the foundation for changes which marked China and
Asia`s entry into the global economic system was laid in the middle of the 18th century.
In particular, one can point to the institution of the Canton system established by the
Chinese government to facilitate foreign trade, but which had various unforeseen
economic, social, and political repercussions. Through 13 weeks of lectures, students
will not only examine various themes such as migration, diaspora, colonialism,
nationalism, and trade which relate generally to global historical studies, but they will
also participate in current debates pertaining to the issues of global economic crises
and climate change.

This module challenges students to consider the viability of defining Southeast Asia as
a 'region`. It introduces students to major themes in the emergence of Southeast Asian
countries as modern nation-states during the 20th century. The approach is both
comparative and based on case studies; it explores broad themes and trends for the
region while examining specific case studies in detail. In addition, the students will also
examine the differential impact which colonialism and nationalism had on different
sectors of Southeast Asian societies.

This course focuses on the evolution of Singapore in the regional and global contexts
since 1945. It will discuss various factors--institutional, cultural, socio-political and
international?that have shaped the trajectory of Singapore over the past seven
decades. The successful story of Singapore`s economic development will be
understood within the domestic multi-ethnic mosaic and complex regional relationships.
It is the interplay of these forces that underscores the emergence and challenges of a
cosmopolitan global city-state with an emerging national identity.

This course introduces students to key themes in the social, political, and cultural history of Europe from the French Revolution to the twenty first century. We will ask how and why Europe came to dominate the world in the nineteenth century and why it lost that dominance in the twentieth. Why did Europe give birth both to models of democracy and social equality but also to dictatorship and terror? Why has Europe been such a laboratory for nationalism and does the emergence of the European Union signal the end of this epoch?

This course aims to provide a macro-level analysis of the history of global health over
the past two hundred years. It begins with colonial conceptions of health, and examines
a series of global health efforts ranging from the therapeutic revolution, eradication
campaigns, the primary health care movement, and aging and health. It will also discuss
the changing roles of the state and international organizations in the evolution of global
health efforts. Specific case studies on Europe, North America, and Asia will be used for
comparative analyses of the above topics, which will enhance the understanding of the
interplay between health, structure and environments.

This course is intended to whet students` appetites for a new interdisciplinary field,
which focuses on the histories of everyone`s favorite past-time: eating! The course will
be structured thematically rather than chronologically, commencing with a focus on the
economics of food purchasing, its preparation, the rituals and practices associated with
its consumption, including the development of table manners and the use of various
implements as well as the acts of eating or abstaining. Various religious and cultural
dietary regulations and taboos will be examined next, before a series of case studies
looking at the connections between food and world politics: such as colonialism and
nationalism. The development of food consumption as a leisure and social activity will
also be analysed, before the course concludes with a study of the gendered aspects of
food history in an interdisciplinary perspective.

British colonialism had important impacts upon colonized societies and understanding colonialism is important to understanding our contemporary post-colonial moment.  This course examines the ways different forms of colonial power intersected with race, gender and class.  With a focus on the British Empire, we will look at the manner in which colonial governments sought to settle, trade, govern, ?civilise,? know, and link the Empire.  Students will enter into debates about the nature of British colonial power: was it a unified project or unstable, violent or intimate?  We will analyse the relationship between the British metropole and the colonies, including the flow of ideas, people and goods within imperial networks and the 'counterflows' from colonial sites back to Britain.  This course also asks how colonised people interacted with British colonial governments and institutions and how race, class and gender structured interactions between and amongst the colonisers and the colonised. We will examine everyday strategies colonised people adopted, from challenging colonial power to collaboration, as well as look at settler and anti-imperialist nationalisms.  This course will examine `settler colonies' and `exploitation colonies' across the globe, but will have particular focus on colonies in Asia and the Pacific.

This course covers modern business history, drawing on case studies from the UK, Europe, America and Asia. This course takes a comparative approach to explore the development of modern businesses across Western and Asian societies. Business historians investigate both small and large enterprises and their management practices.
Importantly, they also consider the economic, political and social environments in which these businesses operate; this will also be our approach over the semester. The scope of this course is from the late 18th Century through until present times; we`ll trace the 10 development of modern business and business networks in Europe, UK, America and Asia. Case studies from historical and contemporary sources allows students to see the relevance of this field of study to our understanding of businesses in the present day.

There is crime and there is, supposedly, punishment. Behind law and order, or disorder, there were tears, blood, emotions, stories and history. The history of crime and punishment can be as sexy as detective novel and as sad and prefund as Greek tragedy. This course provides an introduction to Chinese legal history through an examination of the judicial practice, evolution of codified law and other aspects of legal culture in the late imperial period. The Ming and Qing dynasties' criminal cases, law, and legal procedures are the central topics of the course. We will also explore how Europeans viewed China's criminal justice and how their imperial gaze changed China's history of crime and punishment.

This course offers a comparative approach to nationalism on three levels. In a first part, it looks into the main theories and paradigms of nationalism, as well as into Asian critiques of the ?European? construct of nationalism as tied to the history of European industrialization and Enlightenment. On this first level, the limitations of generalizing theories of nationalism and their implications with regard to Asia will be explored. 

Secondly, instead of limiting the study of nationalism to an East Asian, Southeast Asian, or South Asian context, the course compares how nationalism was shaped in these various parts of Asia at the beginning of the twentieth century in response to empire and colony. On this level, the notion of transnationalism in the regional context of Asia will be explored further through an investigation of the concept of ?Asianism.? 

On a third level, the course looks at contemporary manifestations of nationalism in Asia from a thematic angle. The case studies in part three will be analyzed with reference to both theories and histories discussed in parts one and two, thereby paying attention to both the continuation of nationalism and challenges to the nation-state in the context of globalization.

In order to understand past events, it is also important to understand why certain actors did what they did to influence the course of events. In other words, what did these actors think and how did they understand the world around them? Using an intellectual history framework, this course looks at the main themes and debates of twentieth-century China through the angle of some of its main thinkers, thereby paying attention to the specific contexts in which intellectuals put forward these ideas. Among others, we will look into socialism, liberalism, conservatism, and nationalism; the various debates we will study address the nature of Chinese modernity and its economic, political, and cultural tenets.

Starting in the late nineteenth century, when exchange programs and contact with foreigners in China led intellectuals to question their existing worldviews, this course moves chronologically and thematically across the twentieth century. From the late 1800s, we move on to intellectuals of the important May Fourth era?including thinkers of various political persuasions?as well as Mao Zedong thought. In a final section, intellectual developments of modern China will be linked to contemporary outgrowths. We will briefly discuss liberal thinkers of the so-called ?second Enlightenment? period, the 1980s, after which the course will conclude with the rise of New Confucianism and debates between the New Left and liberal intellectuals during the 1990s.

This course examines major themes pertaining to the study of political authority and moral legitimacy of power in Southeast Asia from ancient times to the present day. The characterization of the ?Big Man? captures the essential ideas pertaining to the figure of political and moral authority in the region; the ?Big Man? is not only an ascribed status, but an achieved one as well. The course gives students the historical context within which modern political figures of authority place themselves.  Through the examination of early political institutions and models, the course allows students opportunities to examine in detail the original concepts behind models of moral authority and leadership. Some political leaders of today continue to allude to these earlier models to legitimize their rights to rule, namely among the military regimes of Burma, the royal family and political regime of Thailand, etc. However an examination of the weekly themes will show that even though legitimacy remains an important consideration, the structure of moral authority within the political institutions of Southeast Asia has been greatly transformed over the centuries. The advent of colonialism clearly has a major impact on political institutions and structures in colonized states, but also in Thailand, where the Thai monarchy carried out programs of centralization, ?modernization?, and ?reforms? to keep the colonialists at bay. What occurred in Thailand was not colonialism from outside, but from within.

This course examines some of the major and still influential theoretical models of statecraft, kingship, and political institutions in Southeast Asia from the premodern through modern eras. The breakdown of topics ensures that a wide variety of topics are examined and ample case studies provided, both for the precolonial, colonial, and postcolonial periods.
