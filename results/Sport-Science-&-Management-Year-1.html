The course aims to help students improve their English language proficiency for use in academic situations.  Tutorials are structured into a 3-wk cycle in which each cycle comprises a blend of workshops, face-to-face and online sessions, and independent study.  Activities are designed to scaffold learning and help students integrate all four language skills, with a focus on writing and speaking.  Materials from the textbook and other sources, e.g. the Internet, recorded student speeches and writing software, are used.

In today's competitive world, it is essential that students learn the crucial career skills early to ensure a competitive edge sharpened with a heightened sense of workplace values and ethics.  This course takes students through a journey of career discovery, understanding and polishing of oneself which will then be translated into job application tools such as resumes and interview skills. 

All students will have the opportunity to undergo a robust Career Assessment Tool, which assesses their career options and career self and helps them chart a career action plan. They will also learn how to identify and articulate the concept of personal branding and applying that to resumes and interviews and online social media. Students will also be exposed to the basics of grooming to ensure that they are aware of the importance of first impressions in all situations.

This seminar challenges students to think rigorously about morality. The first part of the course explores whether or not moral judgments can be objectively true. Then, we examine several influential philosophical theories of morally right action. Throughout the term, students will be asked to construct and evaluate moral arguments. This will hone the student's ability to reason about issues of moral concern. 

In this module students will learn about the writings of thinkers who lived centuries ago, as well as important works by contemporary philosophers. It will become apparent that intelligent people can disagree about moral issues, and that no one person's moral views are beyond criticism. However, careful study will reveal that some views concerning morality are more credible than others. The student's task will be to evaluate the various perspectives and form a reasoned judgment as to how the central questions of the course should be answered.

The aim of this interdisciplinary course is to engage students from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds to develop an enhanced awareness of knowledge organization and innovation within a globalizing world, in which they are trained to become active leaders in their major of studies. In the past, human societies embedded their knowledge and values in complex interactions of written, pictorial, sculptural and architectural records, oral memories, and performed rituals. These were their media and in these forms we inherited their arts and science. Now, our society is very close to a fully digital access to all information encapsulated in monuments, museums, galleries, libraries, archives and live performances all over the world and in any language. But to distil data into knowledge, a new generation of scholars, artists, and professionals needs to discuss, test, and implement ICT tools and solutions in correlation with 1) the centuries-old results of each single discipline, which contributes to the domain of heritage science (in humanities, social sciences, architecture, life sciences, engineering, and computer sciences) and 2) the technological potential evolution. The object of this course is to contribute to the training of this new generation.

This course aims to equip students with key knowledge in modern astronomy and cosmology. Through the course, students will learn about the history of astronomy, navigating the sky, the origin and content of our solar system, and the evolution of stars and galaxies. Topics including the big bang, the geometry and structure of the universe, dark matter and dark energy, will be discussed to give students an overview of current ideas in modern cosmology and for them to ponder about our place in the universe. The course will also present exciting astronomical discoveries in recent time. During the course, students will also have opportunities to learn practical skills in solar observation and star gazing to supplement their learning of the course.

This course explores sociolinguistic issues with a focus on the societal, cultural, political, psychological, and interactional contexts of language use. Students will have research-based understandings about key theoretical views of language use in society and learn to examine how language use is influenced by social factors and how social categories such as status, ethnicity, and gender can be reflected by language use. Students will also learn how to follow basic principles of sociolinguistics to distinguish functions and varieties of language in a sociocultural context.

Culture and Conflict is a multi-disciplinary course which explores the relationship between artistic production and social / political disorder. It investigates the basic philosophical notion that art thrives in times of war, and expires in peace, then goes on to question whether art, as a form of social barometer, can actually anticipate conflict as opposed to merely responding to it. The course also observes the extent to which culture (especially that derived from conflict) is used to create specific social identities and contemporary concepts of memory. A range of historically and geographically diverse case studies will be used: the Medieval and Renaissance Mediterranean, the First World War in Europe, the `Troubles? in Northern Ireland in the 1980s, and present day Singapore. Whether we are looking at the anticipation of war through the ballet, or increasingly avant-garde sculpture, or observing medieval multiculturalism through a microscopic examination of a painted surface or a virtual reconstruction of Cypriot architecture, we are consistently looking at the relationship between culture and conflict. The media of exploration will be: art theory, painting, sculpture, ballet, popular / protest music, architecture, multi-media / technology and international law. Suitable site visits within Singapore to compliment the course will be provided as part of the experiential learning and appreciation of the issues covered in the course.

The process of change is just as apparent in sport as it is in any field of human endeavour. Sport in Singapore is a significant medium for social development that must also be seen to make contributions to the economy, to education, to social activity and to the creation of a national and an international identity. Government initiatives at the turn of the century are gradually being crystallised into meaningful actions affecting the wider population. Active participation in sport is encouraged and the status of sport as a potential career path is emerging more strongly.  Singapore has been recognised as a successful host of an increasing number of events, yet still requires affirmation of its competitive standards at international levels. This course will critically examine the nature and scope of sport related issues that have evolved during the 21st Century.

A lecture/demonstration laboratory course is designed as a foundation course for the study of exercise physiology. Emphasis will be placed on; the energy systems that fuel muscular work, muscle fiber types, aerobic and anaerobic performance and training adaptations, blood lactate after exercise and maximal oxygen uptake. The importance of proper fluid management and aspects of thermoregulation during exercise in the local tropical environment will also be emphasised.

The course aims to provide NTU undergraduate students with the basic skills and knowledge required to learn how to swim.  Participants will learn the correct techniques required to swim the four strokes (frontcrawl, backstroke, butterfly and breaststroke). Skills like threading water, plunges/starts and turns/somersaults will be taught. In addition, FINA rules relating to these strokes will be introduced.
