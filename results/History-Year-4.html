In order to understand past events, it is also important to understand why certain actors did what they did to influence the course of events. In other words, what did these actors think and how did they understand the world around them? Using an intellectual history framework, this course looks at the main themes and debates of twentieth-century China through the angle of some of its main thinkers, thereby paying attention to the specific contexts in which intellectuals put forward these ideas. Among others, we will look into socialism, liberalism, conservatism, and nationalism; the various debates we will study address the nature of Chinese modernity and its economic, political, and cultural tenets.

Starting in the late nineteenth century, when exchange programs and contact with foreigners in China led intellectuals to question their existing worldviews, this course moves chronologically and thematically across the twentieth century. From the late 1800s, we move on to intellectuals of the important May Fourth era?including thinkers of various political persuasions?as well as Mao Zedong thought. In a final section, intellectual developments of modern China will be linked to contemporary outgrowths. We will briefly discuss liberal thinkers of the so-called ?second Enlightenment? period, the 1980s, after which the course will conclude with the rise of New Confucianism and debates between the New Left and liberal intellectuals during the 1990s.

This course examines major themes pertaining to the study of political authority and moral legitimacy of power in Southeast Asia from ancient times to the present day. The characterization of the ?Big Man? captures the essential ideas pertaining to the figure of political and moral authority in the region; the ?Big Man? is not only an ascribed status, but an achieved one as well. The course gives students the historical context within which modern political figures of authority place themselves.  Through the examination of early political institutions and models, the course allows students opportunities to examine in detail the original concepts behind models of moral authority and leadership. Some political leaders of today continue to allude to these earlier models to legitimize their rights to rule, namely among the military regimes of Burma, the royal family and political regime of Thailand, etc. However an examination of the weekly themes will show that even though legitimacy remains an important consideration, the structure of moral authority within the political institutions of Southeast Asia has been greatly transformed over the centuries. The advent of colonialism clearly has a major impact on political institutions and structures in colonized states, but also in Thailand, where the Thai monarchy carried out programs of centralization, ?modernization?, and ?reforms? to keep the colonialists at bay. What occurred in Thailand was not colonialism from outside, but from within.

This course examines some of the major and still influential theoretical models of statecraft, kingship, and political institutions in Southeast Asia from the premodern through modern eras. The breakdown of topics ensures that a wide variety of topics are examined and ample case studies provided, both for the precolonial, colonial, and postcolonial periods.
