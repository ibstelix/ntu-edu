The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

"Green Marketing" examines the role played by marketing in business sustainability and explores the influences and issues confronting marketing strategy decisions and actions on the marketing environment.
The course is designed in two main parts. The first part, comprising 7 seminars, explores theoretical frameworks and concepts that underpin the notion of corporate environmentalism. It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    

The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc.

In today's global and digital business environment, Enterprise Systems are major investments for many organizations. They form the backbone of organizations? business processes and hold the key to unlock strategic information assets within the firms. A good understanding of the role of enterprise systems is thus crucial in running today?s business operations. This course is designed to provide an overview to enterprise systems, primarily covering the range of embedded ?best practice? business processes (e.g., order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, production planning and execution, accounting) and the related managerial issues in assessing, project managing, configuring, and managing the radical change consequential to the implementation of enterprise systems. Our objective is to develop an application consulting perspective among the students to maximize the full potentials of enterprise systems. 
 
The course places a dual emphasis on both conceptual learning (through student-led presentations and business case discussions) and practical exposures (through heavy hands-on lab on SAP) to enterprise systems. Students should acquire a sound entry-level grounding in the ERP software, for them to work towards an industry accredited SAP TERP10 certification if they are interested.

This course aims to assist students to explore from strategic, organizational, and technical perspectives the critical issues surrounding network and data infrastructure design, analysis and management.

The course is comprised of three main components - strategic, organizational and technical. The strategic component of the course deals with current ideas in strategic planning and aims to expose students to concepts from strategic studies and how they apply to network and data planning. Specifically, we are interested to study how traditional strategic thinking e.g., Porter's five forces and more recent strategic ideas of new competition and hyper competition relates to use of technologies in designing networked enterprises. Next, we focus on the technical component i.e., the physical view of the networked enterprise. We take an extensive look at the range of infrastructure including LAN, WAN, Mobile, Internet, as well as data centers that support and enable modern networked enterprises. We round up the coursework by looking at the organizational issues surrounding networked enterprises, viz., coordination and integration designs. While these three components are dealt separately, the goal of the course is to enable participants to appreciate how these strategic, technical and organizational issues are intertwined in the design of networked enterprises. As such, students are expected to work through a group project to map strategic and organizational requirements to network design and planning. Industry presentations and/or visits are also planned to bring alive the integrated nature of these issues.

The international dimension has become a common feature of business and trade. We have all heard the jargon phrases, such as `globalization',`multinational corporation', and `cross-border transactions', many of which are now cliches. Despite this, doing business internationally is not easy. Whether in a broad sense, or in terms of the specific functions and activities of a firm, is international business involves interaction between multiple players, in a dynamic and interconnected environment. 
This course aims to provide students with a clear foundation in the multi-level structure of the international business environment, as an interactive nexus of domestic and global contexts, shaped by institutions, businesses, and stakeholders.

The course is not only relevant for would-be entrepreneurs, but also for those considering a career in commercial banks, investment banks, private equity firms, venture capital firms, as well as in corporate venture investments. This course differs from a typical corporate finance course in that it highlights the special and unique considerations when planning the financial needs of new ventures and young companies. Many typical avenues of funding (such as bank borrowing, issuing of bonds or issuing of liquid equities) for established or public listed companies are not accessible to small and young companies due to the lack of business track record. The analyses and requirements of investors who are considering providing finances to small and young companies may also be different from that of public equity investments. This course will provide students with the understanding of various aspects and processes in financial planning and financial management of new ventures or young companies, as well as investment analyses and considerations for investors providing funding to such companies.
