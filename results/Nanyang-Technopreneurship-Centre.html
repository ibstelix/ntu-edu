Entrepreneurs are the creators and builders of new ventures that not only fulfill their own dreams, bring them huge fortune but also make a strong impact on the society and improve the lives of people. A successful venture will lead to new or improved products/services, create new jobs and add values for owners, investors and the society. Starting up a venture is not difficult if you know how although a successful venture requires more than knowledge on entrepreneurship. This course is an exploration into the fundamentals of entrepreneurship. Upon successful completion of the course, you would have a good understanding of entrepreneurship; the issues encountered on the entrepreneurial journey; and most importantly, how you can become an entrepreneur yourself. Specifically, the course covers aspects of accounting and finance essential for entrepreneurial venture, basic concepts on commercialization of technology, management of intellectual property and entry and exit strategies.

This is an immersive experiential learning module. An online business simulator is used as a platform to let students experience the process of managing a business through the virtual media. Students are exposed to some of the major business decisions that entrepreneurs face when growing their ventures and competing with other companies in the same industry. 

Students are grouped into teams and the teams will compete with one another. As students work through the organization's life cycle in the simulation, external forces and managerial dilemmas are added.  Students will apply the various tools, case-studies and theories from previous modules as the new venture expands its operations and subsequently tackle new tasks, take on additional responsibilities and make difficult decisions.

While ET9134 let students experience the process of creating and managing a business in the virtual environment, in this module, students are required to launch an actual business.  

This module allows students to experience the critical role of opportunity creation & recognition, and to practice the method of evaluating new venture concepts.  Essentially this course integrates what students have learned in earlier parts of the Entrepreneurship Minor.  Throughout this module, students will be exposed to the many 'ups and downs' that starting and operating a new business venture and / or an under-performing or `turn-around company? entails.
