This seminar challenges students to think rigorously about morality. The first part of the course explores whether or not moral judgments can be objectively true. Then, we examine several influential philosophical theories of morally right action. Throughout the term, students will be asked to construct and evaluate moral arguments. This will hone the student's ability to reason about issues of moral concern. 

In this module students will learn about the writings of thinkers who lived centuries ago, as well as important works by contemporary philosophers. It will become apparent that intelligent people can disagree about moral issues, and that no one person's moral views are beyond criticism. However, careful study will reveal that some views concerning morality are more credible than others. The student's task will be to evaluate the various perspectives and form a reasoned judgment as to how the central questions of the course should be answered.

The aim of this interdisciplinary course is to engage students from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds to develop an enhanced awareness of knowledge organization and innovation within a globalizing world, in which they are trained to become active leaders in their major of studies. In the past, human societies embedded their knowledge and values in complex interactions of written, pictorial, sculptural and architectural records, oral memories, and performed rituals. These were their media and in these forms we inherited their arts and science. Now, our society is very close to a fully digital access to all information encapsulated in monuments, museums, galleries, libraries, archives and live performances all over the world and in any language. But to distil data into knowledge, a new generation of scholars, artists, and professionals needs to discuss, test, and implement ICT tools and solutions in correlation with 1) the centuries-old results of each single discipline, which contributes to the domain of heritage science (in humanities, social sciences, architecture, life sciences, engineering, and computer sciences) and 2) the technological potential evolution. The object of this course is to contribute to the training of this new generation.

This course explores sociolinguistic issues with a focus on the societal, cultural, political, psychological, and interactional contexts of language use. Students will have research-based understandings about key theoretical views of language use in society and learn to examine how language use is influenced by social factors and how social categories such as status, ethnicity, and gender can be reflected by language use. Students will also learn how to follow basic principles of sociolinguistics to distinguish functions and varieties of language in a sociocultural context.

Culture and Conflict is a multi-disciplinary course which explores the relationship between artistic production and social / political disorder. It investigates the basic philosophical notion that art thrives in times of war, and expires in peace, then goes on to question whether art, as a form of social barometer, can actually anticipate conflict as opposed to merely responding to it. The course also observes the extent to which culture (especially that derived from conflict) is used to create specific social identities and contemporary concepts of memory. A range of historically and geographically diverse case studies will be used: the Medieval and Renaissance Mediterranean, the First World War in Europe, the `Troubles? in Northern Ireland in the 1980s, and present day Singapore. Whether we are looking at the anticipation of war through the ballet, or increasingly avant-garde sculpture, or observing medieval multiculturalism through a microscopic examination of a painted surface or a virtual reconstruction of Cypriot architecture, we are consistently looking at the relationship between culture and conflict. The media of exploration will be: art theory, painting, sculpture, ballet, popular / protest music, architecture, multi-media / technology and international law. Suitable site visits within Singapore to compliment the course will be provided as part of the experiential learning and appreciation of the issues covered in the course.
