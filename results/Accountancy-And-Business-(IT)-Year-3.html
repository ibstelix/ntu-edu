        In today's global and digital business environment, Enterprise Systems are major investments for many organizations. They form the backbone of organizations? business processes and hold the key to unlock strategic information assets within the firms. A good understanding of the role of enterprise systems is thus crucial in running today?s business operations. This course is designed to provide an overview to enterprise systems, primarily covering the range of embedded ?best practice? business processes (e.g., order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, production planning and execution, accounting) and the related managerial issues in assessing, project managing, configuring, and managing the radical change consequential to the implementation of enterprise systems. Our objective is to develop an application consulting perspective among the students to maximize the full potentials of enterprise systems. 
 
The course places a dual emphasis on both conceptual learning (through student-led presentations and business case discussions) and practical exposures (through heavy hands-on lab on SAP) to enterprise systems. Students should acquire a sound entry-level grounding in the ERP software, for them to work towards an industry accredited SAP TERP10 certification if they are interested.

        This course aims to assist students to explore from strategic, organizational, and technical perspectives the critical issues surrounding network and data infrastructure design, analysis and management.

The course is comprised of three main components - strategic, organizational and technical. The strategic component of the course deals with current ideas in strategic planning and aims to expose students to concepts from strategic studies and how they apply to network and data planning. Specifically, we are interested to study how traditional strategic thinking e.g., Porter's five forces and more recent strategic ideas of new competition and hyper competition relates to use of technologies in designing networked enterprises. Next, we focus on the technical component i.e., the physical view of the networked enterprise. We take an extensive look at the range of infrastructure including LAN, WAN, Mobile, Internet, as well as data centers that support and enable modern networked enterprises. We round up the coursework by looking at the organizational issues surrounding networked enterprises, viz., coordination and integration designs. While these three components are dealt separately, the goal of the course is to enable participants to appreciate how these strategic, technical and organizational issues are intertwined in the design of networked enterprises. As such, students are expected to work through a group project to map strategic and organizational requirements to network design and planning. Industry presentations and/or visits are also planned to bring alive the integrated nature of these issues.
