This course consists of several parts.

1.	Introduction

This part introduces the fundamental ideas and challenges in problem solving and decision making, with an emphasis on the roles of qualitative reasoning and quantitative reasoning. 

2.	Quantitative Reasoning with Complexity

This part introduces students to the problem-solving and decision making process and the basic ideas and techniques in optimization. 

3.	Quantitative Reasoning with Uncertainty and Risk

This part studies the basic concepts and techniques in decision analysis. We will review the basics in probability and statistics and then introduce students to the basic ideas and techniques in decision analysis including utility theory.

4.	Quantitative Reasoning with Conflict and Competition

This part introduces students to decision making with conflict and competitive, and the basic concepts and techniques in negotiation and game theories.

This seminar challenges students to think rigorously about morality. The first part of the course explores whether or not moral judgments can be objectively true. Then, we examine several influential philosophical theories of morally right action. Throughout the term, students will be asked to construct and evaluate moral arguments. This will hone the student's ability to reason about issues of moral concern. 

In this module students will learn about the writings of thinkers who lived centuries ago, as well as important works by contemporary philosophers. It will become apparent that intelligent people can disagree about moral issues, and that no one person's moral views are beyond criticism. However, careful study will reveal that some views concerning morality are more credible than others. The student's task will be to evaluate the various perspectives and form a reasoned judgment as to how the central questions of the course should be answered.
