This course is designed to help students understand and implement techniques that underlie research on the management of human resources in organizations. Research plays an integral role in the management of people in today's organizations. Companies value talent with the skills to apply scientific research practices to help improve employee productivity and well-being. Similarly, many organizations also engage external consultants to help solve problems with their workforce via research. This course will equip students with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to function as both internal and external research consultants. The course begins with discussions of the principles of scientific research, and how they can be applied in a HR context. We then progress to cover the various aspects of designing research to investigate HR-related issues. Students will then learn to use statistical analysis to inform understanding of HR phenomena. The course finally ends with discussions and activities designed to help students report and present research findings.
