The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

"Green Marketing" examines the role played by marketing in business sustainability and explores the influences and issues confronting marketing strategy decisions and actions on the marketing environment.
The course is designed in two main parts. The first part, comprising 7 seminars, explores theoretical frameworks and concepts that underpin the notion of corporate environmentalism. It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    

The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc.

This course provides students with the conceptual background and analytical skills that are necessary to identify, assess and apply information for the purposes of analysing and valuing business activities and entities. The course employs the agency framework within a capital market context to help students develop the necessary analysis and valuation skills.

Emphasis is placed on integrating the use of financial and non-financial information in business valuation and analysis, involving strategy analysis, accounting analysis, financial analysis, prospective analysis and valuation. The course allows students to understand the critical issue of determining the specific types of information that are relevant in ex ante valuation and ex post analysis of business entities and their activities. Students are also expected to be aware of the benefits and costs of acquiring and using such information.
 
Cases and projects are used to develop and integrate the business analysis and valuation concepts.  Healthy scepticism is emphasized, as students are encouraged to challenge the assumptions and facts related to each issue. 

After the completion of this course, students should understand and appreciate some of the rationales and characteristics that underlie business practices and financial reporting. Students should also appreciate the myriad interactions among the process of business analysis and valuation, the use of information sets (accounting and non-accounting), and the workings of the capital markets.

Students are expected to develop important knowledge, skills and attitudes in AA301. The main objectives are to develop students? (1) social and interpersonal skills, (2) technical knowledge of specific accounting standards, (3) technical knowledge of business valuation, (4) creative and critical thinking, (5) tolerance for ambiguity in a dynamic environment, and (6) strategic thinking and leadership capabilities in a vibrant environment.
