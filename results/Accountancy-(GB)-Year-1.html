The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

"Green Marketing" examines the role played by marketing in business sustainability and explores the influences and issues confronting marketing strategy decisions and actions on the marketing environment.
The course is designed in two main parts. The first part, comprising 7 seminars, explores theoretical frameworks and concepts that underpin the notion of corporate environmentalism. It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    

The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc.

Communication Management Fundamentals introduces students to the crucial communication skills required of today's employees, young entrepreneurs and job hunters.
 
Achieving success in one's career is often symptomatic of his or her ability to develop cooperative work relationships, collaborate with and across teams, convey ideas clearly, concisely and convincingly, and listen skilfully. More than ever before, the ability to communicate effectively determines an employee's capacity to thrive in his or her career and to be in demand by employers. Entrepreneurs, alike, must also communicate well in order to articulate and present their ideas to customers, suppliers, the government, and other partners in the business ecosystem.

This course is structured to hone students' business communication skills, especially to prevail in an employment situation and to communicate positive-informative messages at work or in business overall. Students will be assessed on their ability to devise clear communication strategies, write effectively, prepare and deliver compelling oral presentations, and share and address feedback.

The importance of social media and its profound impact on the way people communicate today will also be explored as will be the most effective manner in which such platforms are harnessed for employees and businesses alike.

Specifically, this course aims to develop students? skills in communication management: writing, speaking, listening, and working in teams. The three main objectives of the course are the following:

1. Written communication: Students will learn to strategize and organize a positive-informative
    message in a professional, high quality business document by effectively adapting to the
    contextual requirements and the needs of the given audience.

2. Social media communication: Students will explore and critique good practices for personal
    and/or company image management to better understand the various risks and opportunities
    presented by social media to both individuals and organizations.
 
3. Oral communication: Students will learn to deliver professional, high-quality presentations,
    demonstrate appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication skills, and develop
    compelling content.
