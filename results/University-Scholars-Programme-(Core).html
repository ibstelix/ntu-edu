   This seminar challenges students to think rigorously about morality. The first part of the course explores whether or not moral judgments can be objectively true. Then, we examine several influential philosophical theories of morally right action. Throughout the term, students will be asked to construct and evaluate moral arguments. This will hone the student's ability to reason about issues of moral concern. 

In this module students will learn about the writings of thinkers who lived centuries ago, as well as important works by contemporary philosophers. It will become apparent that intelligent people can disagree about moral issues, and that no one person's moral views are beyond criticism. However, careful study will reveal that some views concerning morality are more credible than others. The student's task will be to evaluate the various perspectives and form a reasoned judgment as to how the central questions of the course should be answered.
