The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

"Green Marketing" examines the role played by marketing in business sustainability and explores the influences and issues confronting marketing strategy decisions and actions on the marketing environment.
The course is designed in two main parts. The first part, comprising 7 seminars, explores theoretical frameworks and concepts that underpin the notion of corporate environmentalism. It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    

The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc.

This course introduces students to accounting as a process of measuring and disclosing information that facilitates economic decisions made by external decision makers. Students will learn how the quality of such information could be affected by various factors.  Some of the concepts covered in AA101 such as strategy, business processes, agency theory and information risk will be revisited here.  The course will explain the need for a conceptual framework followed by discussion of the elements of financial statements. The conceptual issues relating to the recognition and measurement of each element in the financial statements will be examined, followed by discussion of the related accounting standards.  
 
By the end of the course, students will be equipped with a strong conceptual and technical knowledge in the recognition and measurement of the elements of the financial statements and will also be able to prepare a set of financial statements, and appreciate how accounting plays a role in measuring and disclosing information that facilitates the control of an organization?s processes and improves the economic decisions made by organizational agents and stakeholders.

The international dimension has become a common feature of business and trade. We have all heard the jargon phrases, such as `globalization',`multinational corporation', and `cross-border transactions', many of which are now cliches. Despite this, doing business internationally is not easy. Whether in a broad sense, or in terms of the specific functions and activities of a firm, is international business involves interaction between multiple players, in a dynamic and interconnected environment. 
This course aims to provide students with a clear foundation in the multi-level structure of the international business environment, as an interactive nexus of domestic and global contexts, shaped by institutions, businesses, and stakeholders.

This course builds on principles covered in AC 208 - Company Law.

Marketing typically deals with identifying and meeting human and social needs. In the center of every marketing strategy stands the consumer. Being able to examine consumers' behavior helps firms and organizations improve their marketing strategies. This course will provide you with the necessary theories and methods to better understand how consumers behave. In particular this course will focus on issues such as 
	The psychology of how consumers think, feel, reason, and select between different alternatives (e.g., brands, products)
	The psychology of how the consumer is influenced by his or her environment (e.g., culture, family, signs, media);
	The behavior of consumers while shopping or making other marketing decisions;
	Limitations in consumer knowledge or information processing abilities influence decisions and marketing outcome; 
	How consumer motivation and decision strategies differ between products that differ in their level of importance or interest that they entail for the consumer; and
	How marketers can adapt and improve their marketing campaigns and marketing strategies to more effectively reach the consumer.

Good marketing is no accident, but a result of careful planning and execution. There is constant tension between analysis of how consumers act under certain circumstances and the translation of these findings into creative marketing strategies. The course is organized in a way that it trains students how to integrate both consumer behavior analysis and creativity into a meaningful strategic symbiosis.

Market intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting both internal and external sources of marketing information so as to enable the company to better understand the market environment in which it competes, thus equipping managers with the timely knowledge to make well-informed marketing decisions in a dynamic environment. Students will learn about traditional and contemporary (e.g., social media) sources of market intelligence, as well as the tools for gathering intelligence information about customers and competitors. Besides acquainting students with a broad overview of market intelligence, this course is also designed to equip students with the skills to design, conduct, and interpret marketing research. Students will also have the opportunity to apply their knowledge by completing a marketing research project. Upon graduation from this class, students should be able to understand the basic principles of market intelligence, be familiar with the tools available, and have a reasonable understanding of how they are applied in the marketplace.

As a result of the interconnected nature of the global economy we need to acknowledge the role that Business-to-Business, Business-to-Consumer and Consumer-to-Consumer relationships plays in marketing. The impact and prevalence of these relationships mean that they should be at the center of firms' decision making. This course helps students to understand the reality of the business markets and the tasks of managing the complex multiple and overlapping relationships in which firms are enmeshed and on which they can rely for competitive success. . It moves away from the traditional 4Ps (product, pricing, promotion and place) paradigm and take a more holistic and integrated approach in understanding marketing.  In addition, a strong relational approach is used in oppose to a transactional view of marketing.  Marketing is viewed in this course as the process of managing and optimizing relationships, networks and interactions. Due to the limitation of the course duration, it is impossible to provide a how-to for managing all these relationships. Instead the course looks closer into the topic of customer relationship management and provides students with the tools and techniques to effectively use CRM.

The primary theme of the course is that service organizations require a distinctive approach to marketing strategy, both in its development and execution. A second theme of the course focuses on the role of service in manufacturing businesses. 

This course will suggest ways that firms in the manufactured goods sector might use 'service' as a primary source of competitive advantage. The design and delivery of services depends on the close coordination between marketing, operations management, information technology and human resources. As a result, an effective strategy to market services must be interdisciplinary in nature.
	
The seminars adopt an active-learning approach so that the student can discover, develop and transform knowledge which he/she can retain for further processing and reconstructionin the future. Activities consist of interactive lectures, discussions and presentations and out-of-classroom group projects. The primary aim of these activities is to help the student better understand the concepts, theories and tools learnt and relate themto the real world.
