The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

"Green Marketing" examines the role played by marketing in business sustainability and explores the influences and issues confronting marketing strategy decisions and actions on the marketing environment.
The course is designed in two main parts. The first part, comprising 7 seminars, explores theoretical frameworks and concepts that underpin the notion of corporate environmentalism. It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    

The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc.

The international dimension has become a common feature of business and trade. We have all heard the jargon phrases, such as `globalization',`multinational corporation', and `cross-border transactions', many of which are now cliches. Despite this, doing business internationally is not easy. Whether in a broad sense, or in terms of the specific functions and activities of a firm, is international business involves interaction between multiple players, in a dynamic and interconnected environment. 
This course aims to provide students with a clear foundation in the multi-level structure of the international business environment, as an interactive nexus of domestic and global contexts, shaped by institutions, businesses, and stakeholders.

The course is not only relevant for would-be entrepreneurs, but also for those considering a career in commercial banks, investment banks, private equity firms, venture capital firms, as well as in corporate venture investments. This course differs from a typical corporate finance course in that it highlights the special and unique considerations when planning the financial needs of new ventures and young companies. Many typical avenues of funding (such as bank borrowing, issuing of bonds or issuing of liquid equities) for established or public listed companies are not accessible to small and young companies due to the lack of business track record. The analyses and requirements of investors who are considering providing finances to small and young companies may also be different from that of public equity investments. This course will provide students with the understanding of various aspects and processes in financial planning and financial management of new ventures or young companies, as well as investment analyses and considerations for investors providing funding to such companies.

Many companies engage in cross-border business and they face important financial questions beyond those found in a purely domestic setting.  This course aims at providing the necessary understanding and tools to evaluate, finance, and manage international business.   The issues and tools discuss are particularly relevant in the context of a country like Singapore which is a small and highly open economy.  All Singapore companies have to somehow engage in international business.

The course will first explain the global financial markets that facilitate international business and explain the key economic linkages among them.  In the context of international finance, understanding foreign exchange rates is crucial. Therefore, this course will also explain exchange rates and those factors that affect the rates. We then examine the challenges for companies created by unexpected changes in exchange rates. We also discuss how, if at all, these firms should manage their exposure to currency fluctuations. 

Next, we explore the traditional areas of corporate finance including capital budgeting, cost of capital and financial structure from the perspective of multinational companies. 

The recent financial crisis and other contemporary global financial issues will also be explored.

Financial derivatives have grown at a phenomenal pace over the past two decades.
However, there remain disagreements about the merits of derivatives. For example, Alan
Greenspan, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, believes that derivatives
increase financial stability; whereas Warren Buffet, the famed investor, asserts that
derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction.

This course helps students to gain better understandings of derivatives and introduces
students to the usages and valuations of derivatives such as options, forward and futures
contracts.

This course explicitly applies finance theories to solve various problems in financial management and investments. Microsoft Excel is a primary tool for implementation. The course enables students to perform financial analysis and to make financial decisions through financial models created with the use of Excel. Students will have ample opportunities to practice numerical analyses and graphical illustrations that arise out of applications in finance such as forecasting financial statement, estimating costs of capital, constructing efficient portfolio, computing covariance matrix, measuring value at risk, pricing options & real options, and fixed-income analytics. Though the course extensively uses Excel, its focus is still finance applications.
