        This course gives a comprehensive overview of methodologies and techniques in molecular and cell biology research.
The lectures will start with the introduction to standard molecular tools and techniques such as restriction endonucleases, vectors, cloning, PCR, sequencing, mutagenesis, and libraries, followed by the applications of radio- and non-radiolabeled tracers. Students will also learn different protein expression systems, protein purification and detection methods, protein nucleic acids/protein interaction analyses and the application of cell and tissue cultures. Students will actively participate in quizzes, which will be held after a series of lectures.

        Six biological topics have been selected covering enzyme to ecology. A short description of each equation and the learning outcomes from each topic has been given below. Every topic will be introduced with investigative approach to the point where mathematics comes in to solve the biological problem. The mathematical principles (equations) are rather simple and well within A-level category. On the other hand, these equations have contributed to the fundamental questions of twentieth century biology. Using each of these equations, the students have to solve numerical problems related to cross-talk between biology and mathematics. This is not meant to teach mathematics as in a typical mathematics course because it is a biology course with emphasis on the importance of mathematics.

        In this module, students will learn how to prepare and perform histomorphometric analyses of tissues and organs of the nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, urinary, reproductive and musculoskeletal systems. At the start of each day, a seminar will be presented by the faculty in-charge to allow students to recap on the organizations and functions of the various systems. The faculty in-charge and teaching assistants will teach the students how to prepare various soft and hard tissues for different histological analyses. Students will also learn to identify histomorphometric differences in various tissues and organs. Students will design dissection and tissue preparation procedures to identify selected pathologies of the aforementioned systems. All students will also be taught the proper procedures of mice dissection. Only euthanized mice will be used in this module. There will also be quizzes conducted during the period of the module. At the end of each day, student will collate and discuss their observations and data with the faculty in-charge in the SMART classroom. At the end of the course, students will need to submit a report and make presentations that will be graded by the faculty in-charge.

        In this course, we will learn to use biophysical techniques to find out information about different types of proteins, in terms of concentration, secondary structure, oligomeric state, reconstitution systems using both detergent and lipid, purity, function and inhibition. 

The students will be provided with a set of initial problems to solve. To solve these problems, a hands-on approach will adopted that will make use of a range of different biophysical techniques. Each of these techniques will provide different types of information about the samples. An important aspect that will be emphasized is to learn the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and to be able to design experiments knowing which techniques should be used first, and which last. 

Each daily session will consist of two parts (morning and afternoon). Each part will start will a 30 min briefing and will end up with a collation of results session and discussion. All days will have associated a pre-recorded video lecture for support, but a live 30 minute briefing will precede all sessions. 
In the first part we will look at ways to determine protein concentration using visible and UV light, and to measure the size of larger particles such as liposomes or detergent micelles using dynamic light scattering. 
The second part will look at how to obtain secondary structure information to assess proper folding, from infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism.  
The third part of the course will focus on size and oligomerization of molecules, and how this can be determined. To do this, we will use standard centrifugation techniques and also analytical ultracentrifugation (velocity and sedimentation).    
The fourth part will look at function, using kast kinetics (stopped flow), fluorescence and channel activity in model lipid bilayers. Inhibition by small molecules will be tested and dose response plots will be used to determine the affinity of the drugs.
