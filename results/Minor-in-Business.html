The objective of this course is to expose non-accounting and non-business students to the environment of accounting and its role in providing information for useful decision making by various stakeholders of business organizations. By the end of the course, students should be able to appreciate the role, scope and value of information for managing business organizations towards achieving their goals.

Students will learn fundamental concepts and techniques in financial and managerial accounting through solving business problems. In this course, students are treated to an understanding of a broad range of the underlying accounting concepts without the need to be involved in too much detail associated with the processes. Whilst non-accounting and non-business students need not have to prepare detailed financial statements, it would be beneficial for them to be able to understand, interpret, analyze and use them.

Topics covered include ? the role of accounting in business; the accounting cycle; understanding, interpretation and analysis of financial statements; and the application of accounting tools for strategic planning and control in a business organization.

This is an introductory course in finance for non-business and non-accounting students, which provides students with a broad understanding of the principles and practice of Business Finance/Financial Management.   The emphasis is on the major financial decisions made by companies and the valuation of investments made by them.  The course starts by examining the various forms of businesses and the importance of interest rates.

Students will learn and apply principles of capital budgeting (calculating the profitability of various projects and deciding which one to proceed) and capital structure (financing approved projects by issuing shares or bonds, or using retained earnings).  The decision to use extra cash to pay dividends or repurchase shares will be analysed and the course concludes with the use of derivatives to protect and enhance the value of firms.

Students intending to take this course should be numerate (good and comfortable with mathematical calculations and formulas) e.g. they should know well compound interest calculations, Sum of Geometric Progression (G.P.) calculation before attending this course.

To function in an organisation, technical skills by themselves are insufficient; they have to be supplemented by management training.  Success in an organisation depends as much on general management skills and understanding operational systems as on technical expertise.  Hence, students need a firm foundation in management skills.  This course is designed for non-business students and aims to equip them with the knowledge, skills and competence in various aspects of management, including: the role of management and managers; decision-making, planning and strategy; managing organisational architecture; managing individuals and groups; and controlling critical organisational processes.

This course is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the current law for the protection of electronic information and electronic content as forms of property. Conversely this course also looks at the potential liability for misuse of information and the publication of detrimental information. 

The use of electronic communications and new media (such as social media, blogs, wikis,  interactive web-pages and video sharing ? where the users are now generating content) continues to challenge the how the law deals with trademarks and brands embodying reputation and copyright of works of art, multimedia, databases, music and authored works. This course aims to provide students with a good grounding in IP law and how far they can be used to protect the interest of electronic property. 

The other main focus is on the regulation of electronic information and communication ? or new media. The knowledge-based economy is underpinned by laws which protect information assets and private information, shapes transactions and provides security for the various interests of parties to electronic transactions. This course is designed to give an appreciation of the relationship between law and technology as well as how businesses must work within the rules affecting the knowledge-based economy. The approaches to the subject will be both practical and critical.
