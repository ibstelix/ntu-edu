It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, reporting and finance. Participants will appreciate why a more holistic measurement and reporting framework and tools are needed to meet the sustainability objectives of the organization.

The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

We will approach the crux of Sustainable Operations in a step-by-step manner by seeking answers to the following questions: 
(1) What is sustainability? How does it affect businesses? 
(2) What kind of operational challenges/opportunities are faced by companies in different sectors in our economy?  
(3) What kind of operational strategies and methods are used to mitigate the life-cycle environmental impacts of their products/operations?

"Green Marketing" examines the role played by marketing in business sustainability and explores the influences and issues confronting marketing strategy decisions and actions on the marketing environment.
The course is designed in two main parts. The first part, comprising 7 seminars, explores theoretical frameworks and concepts that underpin the notion of corporate environmentalism. It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    

The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc.

This course introduces students to accounting as a process of measuring and disclosing information that facilitates economic decisions made by external decision makers. Students will learn how the quality of such information could be affected by various factors.  Some of the concepts covered in AA101 such as strategy, business processes, agency theory and information risk will be revisited here.  The course will explain the need for a conceptual framework followed by discussion of the elements of financial statements. The conceptual issues relating to the recognition and measurement of each element in the financial statements will be examined, followed by discussion of the related accounting standards.  
 
By the end of the course, students will be equipped with a strong conceptual and technical knowledge in the recognition and measurement of the elements of the financial statements and will also be able to prepare a set of financial statements, and appreciate how accounting plays a role in measuring and disclosing information that facilitates the control of an organization?s processes and improves the economic decisions made by organizational agents and stakeholders.

In today's global and digital business environment, Enterprise Systems are major investments for many organizations. They form the backbone of organizations? business processes and hold the key to unlock strategic information assets within the firms. A good understanding of the role of enterprise systems is thus crucial in running today?s business operations. This course is designed to provide an overview to enterprise systems, primarily covering the range of embedded ?best practice? business processes (e.g., order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, production planning and execution, accounting) and the related managerial issues in assessing, project managing, configuring, and managing the radical change consequential to the implementation of enterprise systems. Our objective is to develop an application consulting perspective among the students to maximize the full potentials of enterprise systems. 
 
The course places a dual emphasis on both conceptual learning (through student-led presentations and business case discussions) and practical exposures (through heavy hands-on lab on SAP) to enterprise systems. Students should acquire a sound entry-level grounding in the ERP software, for them to work towards an industry accredited SAP TERP10 certification if they are interested.

This course aims to assist students to explore from strategic, organizational, and technical perspectives the critical issues surrounding network and data infrastructure design, analysis and management.

The course is comprised of three main components - strategic, organizational and technical. The strategic component of the course deals with current ideas in strategic planning and aims to expose students to concepts from strategic studies and how they apply to network and data planning. Specifically, we are interested to study how traditional strategic thinking e.g., Porter's five forces and more recent strategic ideas of new competition and hyper competition relates to use of technologies in designing networked enterprises. Next, we focus on the technical component i.e., the physical view of the networked enterprise. We take an extensive look at the range of infrastructure including LAN, WAN, Mobile, Internet, as well as data centers that support and enable modern networked enterprises. We round up the coursework by looking at the organizational issues surrounding networked enterprises, viz., coordination and integration designs. While these three components are dealt separately, the goal of the course is to enable participants to appreciate how these strategic, technical and organizational issues are intertwined in the design of networked enterprises. As such, students are expected to work through a group project to map strategic and organizational requirements to network design and planning. Industry presentations and/or visits are also planned to bring alive the integrated nature of these issues.
