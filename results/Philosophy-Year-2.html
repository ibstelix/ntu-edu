This course focuses on the evolution of Singapore from 1300s through 2000s within regional and global contexts. It will discuss various factors--institutional, cultural, socio-political and international?that have shaped the trajectory of Singapore?s growth over seven centuries. The successful story of Singapore?s economic development in the 20th century will be understood not only within the domestic multi-ethnic mosaic and complex regional relationships of the 1900s, but as a continuation of trends established during pre-colonial/pre-modern times. It is the interplay of these forces that underscores the formation and challenges of a cosmopolitan global city-state with an emerging national identity.  This course will demonstrate that Singapore?s position as a cosmopolitan city has its roots in pre-modern times when Temasek represented an important node in the trans-Asian trade network between China, India, and the Mediterranean world.

The key objective of the course is to help students to psychologically better manage their transition to the work world in the Singaporean employment landscape through an understanding of the workings of relationships in the workplace. The course contents help students to understand the reality of the prevailing employment relations and how the employment relationship have evolved in Singapore. 

The course introduces the learner to the basic three perspectives of industrial relations viz. the unitarist, pluralist and radical and it implications on relationship in the workplace between the key players in the employment landscape (viz. management, employees, union and the government). The course facilitates the learner in understanding the roles played in the Singaporean context by government as a legislator, regulator and controller, and the unions and employers in developing a harmonious work environment through tripartism. There will also be coverage of importance of manpower planning in harnessing the strengths of the players. The course will address issues related to conflict management among the players, how productivity and performance are achieved as well as current issues faced in the Singaporean employment landscape.

The underlying theme of relationships will facilitate student?s psychological ability to manage their career better on entry to the work world and develop practical skills to deal with the challenges in the employment landscape. Practical illustrations will be used during the learning process to enable students to get a good grasp of concepts, theories and principles.

Contemporary Singapore has been described by observers in many different ways. The country has been perceived by some as a model of economic success and multi-racial harmony. Others have criticized the high degree of state regulation in the nation-state. This course provides a sociological perspective on various aspects of Singapore society, from its historical formation to its post-independence social transformation. Issues to be covered include the question of national identity and culture. We examine whether Singaporeans possess a common identity and a culture to call their own.  Matters concerning the exercise of political power and the maintenance of authority will also be analyzed. We explore methods of governance that shape society and individuals. Finally, we examine social divisions, for example, class, gender, and religious affiliations. Students will learn to develop the 'sociological imagination'- the ability to relate larger societal issues and personal concerns of everyday life.

This course introduces the canonical thinkers (Descartes, Locke, Spinoza and Hume) in philosophy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course challenges students to think about epistemological and metaphysical questions through these historical thinkers. Key questions include, 'What is the self?' 'What the source of knowledge?' 'Can we know the world as it is?' etc. Particular emphasis will be placed on analyzing arguments from the original text, constructing and evaluating strengths of relevant objections. Students will develop high level critical thinking and writing skills by examining these historical texts and be challenged to think about the richness of philosophical issues that resulted from the new modern science.

What kind of thing is the mind? Can a computer be a mind? If we build an incredibly complicated and a powerful computer that does everything a mind does, would it be a mind? Can a computer be conscious? These are the kinds of questions that philosophers of mind have asked, and have
attempted to answer. This class will cover the basic positions that philosophers have taken with regard to the mind, such as dualism, behaviourism, and functionalism. It will further consider the computational theory of mind in some detail, as well as critiques of this theory, and then explore the issues of consciousness and intentionality.
