This course is an introduction to selected problems of enduring philosophical importance. We begin by considering whether it can be rational to believe in the existence of God. This discussion is followed by a unit on the possibility, foundations, and limits of human knowledge. The next unit concerns issues in the philosophy of mind. We ask whether or not states of mind?e.g., conscious thoughts, emotions, sensations, etc.- are purely physical states of the brain/body, and nothing more. We also discuss what it means for a person to have an ?identity.? Another unit explores competing perspectives on whether or not human beings have free will. Finally, we study a sampling of topics in moral philosophy, such as skepticism about morality, proposed standards of morally right conduct, and the nature of a just society. Students will learn a variety of concepts developed to clarify these matters. They will also be exposed to diverse philosophical perspectives, including both Western and non-Western approaches. In addition, students will be challenged to articulate wellreasoned answers to the main questions of the course.

This course is an introduction to the basic concepts and techniques of modern logic, as well as applications of logic to classic philosophical problems and paradoxes. Many age-old philosophical problems are deceptively simple but are in fact quite complicated, and we can easily get confused. The first step towards rational and independent thinking is to clear away such confusions. Symbolic logic is a powerful set of techniques that are used by modern philosophers to think clearly about these
problems. The core of the class will consist of a sequence where students are introduced first to modern propositional logic, and then to predicate (first order) logic, using a natural deduction style proof system. Along the way, we will discuss some classic paradoxes such as the liar paradox,
Zeno?s paradox, and Russell?s paradox, as well as applications of logic to philosophical problems such as the ontological argument for the existence of God. Students will acquire concepts and techniques for thinking clearly and independently about these problems, and will then be able to apply
them to a wide range of problems, not just in philosophy.

Morality has always been an important matter in human society, especially
in our multicultural age. What is the nature of morality? What makes an
action right or wrong? How do we think ethically? This course introduces
students to these and related issues. It covers major moral theories with
particular reference to the contemporary world.

This course introduces the thought of major figures in the Chinese philosophical tradition and examines primary texts (in English translation) in the schools of Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism and Buddhism. Drawing on ideas from these Chinese thinkers, the course also investigates the
treatment of fundamental issues in Chinese philosophy, such as virtue, freedom, reason, reality, knowledge, love, harmony, and the good life. These subjects are studied for both their historical and modern significance.

This course introduces the canonical thinkers (Descartes, Locke, Spinoza and Hume) in philosophy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course challenges students to think about epistemological and metaphysical questions through these historical thinkers. Key questions include, 'What is the self?' 'What the source of knowledge?' 'Can we know the world as it is?' etc. Particular emphasis will be placed on analyzing arguments from the original text, constructing and evaluating strengths of relevant objections. Students will develop high level critical thinking and writing skills by examining these historical texts and be challenged to think about the richness of philosophical issues that resulted from the new modern science.

This course provides a broad overview of the major philosophical issues associated with science to students without a background in philosophy. It introduces the views on the distinctive features of science and scientific progress espoused by such influential philosophers as Popper, Kuhn, and
Lakatos. It also examines issues related to causation, confirmation, explanation, scientific inference, scientific realism, and laws of nature.

What kind of thing is the mind? Can a computer be a mind? If we build an incredibly complicated and a powerful computer that does everything a mind does, would it be a mind? Can a computer be conscious? These are the kinds of questions that philosophers of mind have asked, and have
attempted to answer. This class will cover the basic positions that philosophers have taken with regard to the mind, such as dualism, behaviourism, and functionalism. It will further consider the computational theory of mind in some detail, as well as critiques of this theory, and then explore the issues of consciousness and intentionality.
