This subject involves studying the organization, operations, planning and analysis of managing in the nonprofit environment. The course covers a variety of themes, such as managing volunteers, fundraising, lobbying, public education, publicity, marketing, and most importantly, how to create a new nonprofit organization. Analysis is based on lectures, guest speakers, textbook, and on-site student
observations. In nonprofit organizations, managers confront the challenge of pursuing a social mission while operating within the constraints of highly competitive markets. To manage well under
these circumstances requires both rigorous analytical tools and a sophisticated understanding of how to balance the demands of ofttimes conflicting constituencies. This course uses a mix of theory
and case studies to develop the rich set of tools required to manage in this environment.

This seminar challenges students to think rigorously about morality. The first part of the course explores whether or not moral judgments can be objectively true. Then, we examine several influential philosophical theories of morally right action. Throughout the term, students will be asked to construct and evaluate moral arguments. This will hone the student's ability to reason about issues of moral concern. 

In this module students will learn about the writings of thinkers who lived centuries ago, as well as important works by contemporary philosophers. It will become apparent that intelligent people can disagree about moral issues, and that no one person's moral views are beyond criticism. However, careful study will reveal that some views concerning morality are more credible than others. The student's task will be to evaluate the various perspectives and form a reasoned judgment as to how the central questions of the course should be answered.

The aim of this interdisciplinary course is to engage students from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds to develop an enhanced awareness of knowledge organization and innovation within a globalizing world, in which they are trained to become active leaders in their major of studies. In the past, human societies embedded their knowledge and values in complex interactions of written, pictorial, sculptural and architectural records, oral memories, and performed rituals. These were their media and in these forms we inherited their arts and science. Now, our society is very close to a fully digital access to all information encapsulated in monuments, museums, galleries, libraries, archives and live performances all over the world and in any language. But to distil data into knowledge, a new generation of scholars, artists, and professionals needs to discuss, test, and implement ICT tools and solutions in correlation with 1) the centuries-old results of each single discipline, which contributes to the domain of heritage science (in humanities, social sciences, architecture, life sciences, engineering, and computer sciences) and 2) the technological potential evolution. The object of this course is to contribute to the training of this new generation.

Through the course, students will learn about the history of astronomy, navigating the sky, the origin and content of our solar system, and the evolution of stars and galaxies. Topics including the big bang, the geometry and structure of the universe, dark matter and dark energy, will be discussed to give students an overview of current ideas in modern cosmology and for them to ponder about our place in the universe. The course will also present exciting astronomical discoveries in recent time. During the course, students will also have opportunities to learn practical skills in solar observation and star gazing to supplement their learning of the course.

The course introduces students to the workings of the human body starting with an exploration of the cell, the fundamental building block of the body. The role and function of the cellular organelles will be taught. The pathway by which genetic information stored in the form of DNA is translated into protein. Signaling pathways mediates and integrates cellular function. The concept of homeostasis will be introduced. Intercellular signaling by the nervous and endocrine systems allows coordination of the different systems in the human body. The circulatory and immune system will be introduced. Major diseases such as cancer, metabolic and infectious diseases which affect the body will be discussed.

This course introduces students to the topics of innovation, enterprise and leadership and how these are interlinked. Not only will students develop a strong conceptual understanding of the frameworks underlying each of these areas but also how these principles are applied and practiced in the real world.

This course explores sociolinguistic issues with a focus on the societal, cultural, political, psychological, and interactional contexts of language use. Students will have research-based understandings about key theoretical views of language use in society and learn to examine how language use is influenced by social factors and how social categories such as status, ethnicity, and gender can be reflected by language use. Students will also learn how to follow basic principles of sociolinguistics to distinguish functions and varieties of language in a sociocultural context.

Culture and Conflict is a multi-disciplinary course which explores the relationship between artistic production and social / political disorder. It investigates the basic philosophical notion that art thrives in times of war, and expires in peace, then goes on to question whether art, as a form of social barometer, can actually anticipate conflict as opposed to merely responding to it. The course also observes the extent to which culture (especially that derived from conflict) is used to create specific social identities and contemporary concepts of memory. A range of historically and geographically diverse case studies will be used: the Medieval and Renaissance Mediterranean, the First World War in Europe, the `Troubles? in Northern Ireland in the 1980s, and present day Singapore. Whether we are looking at the anticipation of war through the ballet, or increasingly avant-garde sculpture, or observing medieval multiculturalism through a microscopic examination of a painted surface or a virtual reconstruction of Cypriot architecture, we are consistently looking at the relationship between culture and conflict. The media of exploration will be: art theory, painting, sculpture, ballet, popular / protest music, architecture, multi-media / technology and international law. Suitable site visits within Singapore to compliment the course will be provided as part of the experiential learning and appreciation of the issues covered in the course.
