This course will introduce the students to the issues of writing for creative media. Text plays a significant part in many creative works. Such things as films, adverts, games and web experiences all require the involvement of a writer or a writing team. Such writing has to engage with the visual materiality of the art and is often in a creative dialogue with its form and content. This course develops in the student the beginnings of a personal voice in writing and will introduce them to notable examples in the field.

This is the first of two introductory modules on Asian art offered in the undergraduate programme. This course presents in critical, social and historical context the range of artefacts and works of art from China, India and Japan, including pottery, ritual vessels and figurines. Also covered are some aspects of architecture, sculpture, painting and woodblock prints. The materials covered span an extensive timeline, from c2000BC until c1500AD. The course sets out to study selected topics by examining pertinent materials in some detail. In doing so the art is placed into context with religious, philosophical and cultural issues.

In this course the students will further develop the ideas and approaches outlined in DN1002. It places form, colour, composition and signs within a broader cultural and historical context and seeks to inculcate in the student an ability to place their own work under the beginnings of a critical examination. This course involves practice-based experimentation with a range of media and techniques such as hand graphics, print and computer aided design. Projects of increasing complexity will make demands on students' developing practical and intellectual skills. Self initiated discovery and risk-taking are encouraged. Credit will be given for a willingness to experiment and find unusual and innovative solutions to problems.

This course introduces Foundation students to expanded forms of narrative beyond the screen and image. Building on the principles of art and design that were introduced in DN1004 Foundation 4D I, students will work with tools, materials and processes that will enable them to develop basic competencies in formulating ideas and content for narrative forms that integrate environment, movement and meaning. The students will be exposed to ideas of time-based art and design that examine relationships between the body, media, technology and environment. Students will further develop basic cognitive, practical and storytelling skills that will be of relevance to their chosen areas of forthcoming specialization.

This seminar challenges students to think rigorously about morality. The first part of the course explores whether or not moral judgments can be objectively true. Then, we examine several influential philosophical theories of morally right action. Throughout the term, students will be asked to construct and evaluate moral arguments. This will hone the student's ability to reason about issues of moral concern. 

In this module students will learn about the writings of thinkers who lived centuries ago, as well as important works by contemporary philosophers. It will become apparent that intelligent people can disagree about moral issues, and that no one person's moral views are beyond criticism. However, careful study will reveal that some views concerning morality are more credible than others. The student's task will be to evaluate the various perspectives and form a reasoned judgment as to how the central questions of the course should be answered.

The aim of this interdisciplinary course is to engage students from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds to develop an enhanced awareness of knowledge organization and innovation within a globalizing world, in which they are trained to become active leaders in their major of studies. In the past, human societies embedded their knowledge and values in complex interactions of written, pictorial, sculptural and architectural records, oral memories, and performed rituals. These were their media and in these forms we inherited their arts and science. Now, our society is very close to a fully digital access to all information encapsulated in monuments, museums, galleries, libraries, archives and live performances all over the world and in any language. But to distil data into knowledge, a new generation of scholars, artists, and professionals needs to discuss, test, and implement ICT tools and solutions in correlation with 1) the centuries-old results of each single discipline, which contributes to the domain of heritage science (in humanities, social sciences, architecture, life sciences, engineering, and computer sciences) and 2) the technological potential evolution. The object of this course is to contribute to the training of this new generation.

Culture and Conflict is a multi-disciplinary course which explores the relationship between artistic production and social / political disorder. It investigates the basic philosophical notion that art thrives in times of war, and expires in peace, then goes on to question whether art, as a form of social barometer, can actually anticipate conflict as opposed to merely responding to it. The course also observes the extent to which culture (especially that derived from conflict) is used to create specific social identities and contemporary concepts of memory. A range of historically and geographically diverse case studies will be used: the Medieval and Renaissance Mediterranean, the First World War in Europe, the `Troubles? in Northern Ireland in the 1980s, and present day Singapore. Whether we are looking at the anticipation of war through the ballet, or increasingly avant-garde sculpture, or observing medieval multiculturalism through a microscopic examination of a painted surface or a virtual reconstruction of Cypriot architecture, we are consistently looking at the relationship between culture and conflict. The media of exploration will be: art theory, painting, sculpture, ballet, popular / protest music, architecture, multi-media / technology and international law. Suitable site visits within Singapore to compliment the course will be provided as part of the experiential learning and appreciation of the issues covered in the course.
