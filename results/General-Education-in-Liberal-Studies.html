Practical Ethics' is a course for students who want to make sense of the idea of right and wrong in a commonsense and practical way that relates to the world we live in (especially in the business context) that is informed by a firm introduction to the main ideas of some of the most important ethical theories.

The first half of the course is an introduction to the elements of ethical reasoning and the main branches of ethical theories and some of their chief modern proponents.  This lays the groundwork for the second half: which will critically apply these concepts thus examined to a consideration of the role of law and ethics in some of the paradigmatic issues and situations in three areas which confront businesses and people in all fields of practical endeavour today, under the headings: Profit, People, Planet.  These may include:  corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (profit), employment equality and child labour (people), international business and public corruption, and environmental sustainability (planet). The seminars will be structured around problems (hypothethical and real) and possibly a few video clips for discussions which are intended to be interesting and engaging whilst providing the context for a serious inquiry into the issues.  Leaders of all kinds, especially those of businesses, are expected in today?s world to be sensitive to ethical dimensions of our reality. This course aims to provide the foundation for such ethical understanding and thinking.

The assessment will be based entirely on coursework: participation, presentation, and a written assignment. There are no prerequisites for the course.

Tourism occupies an important place in society and this course deals with the many roles it plays and purposes served. Following accounts of its current and past stages of development, the psychological and social significance of tourism are explored. Its various meanings are discussed, including within the context of religion and food. Socio-cultural impacts of tourist activity are assessed and the use of culture as a tourist attraction is reviewed which includes consideration of the relationship between history, heritage and tourism. Tourism's interactions with the environment and its contribution to sustainable development are another topic, as is the politics of tourism which extends to matters of terrorism and its effects. 

Finally, the attributes of tourism as a business and questions of destination marketing are addressed before debate about future scenarios. While illustrations are drawn from Singapore and the region, discussions will range more widely and encompass cases from around the world.

This course provides an overview of the complex relationship between two universal human activities that not only satisfy our basic needs (to survive and to communicate), but have a deep symbolic, often ritualised, cultural component as well. By drawing on linguistics, linguistic anthropology, sociology, cognitive science and media studies, the course introduces the interdisciplinary field of linguistics by examining the interplay between language and food-related practices (food classification and naming, food preparation, eating and drinking) in various historical and socio-cultural contexts around the world. It tells a story of food names and cross-cultural contact and borrowing, of what metaphors are and how they are formed, of the `grammar? of various culinary traditions, of social stratification and symbolic capital as they are related to `food talk?, of regional linguistic variation, and of advertising. The course addresses an engaging topic in order to familiarise students with a number of important social scientific concepts, and to develop their critical thinking skills.

Work in the 21st Century, is characterised by competition on a global scale, where jobs are becoming increasingly knowledge-intensive and technology-driven, and where constant change is the rule rather than the exception.  This course aims to provide students with an understanding of some areas of study within the field of behavioural science that are relevant and applicable to the work situation.  Working in the 21st Century explores the role of socio-psychological factors among individual and work group behaviour as a basis for understanding our place in the work setting.  The lecture topics present four areas of interest - personality and work, occupational health, learning-performance, and career development.  While each section is designed to be a stand-alone module, all the four areas of study are fully integrated within the general context of the work situation in organisations.  Empirical findings from applied research are used to explain psychological principles and concepts and the course emphasizes a practical approach to applying psychology in the workplace.

We are living in a postmodern world where the technology changes rapidly. Such rapid change in technology would bring with it changes in the culture in which we live. People also migrate from one cultural community to another cultural community, either as sojourners or students or as immigrants. Cultural transition has become an important part of every modern professional's life. In this course, we will introduce classical and modern theories on sojourning, migration and acculturation. We will also introduce strategies of coping and thriving in cultural transitions, including coping with cultural diversity in multilingual and multiethnic societies. Finally, we will discuss the process of acculturation and adjustment to a new culture, and the patterns of the host country's reaction and accommodation to the new immigrants.

In addition to introducing the background and policy issues behind China's 'economic miracle', the subject also discusses broad implications of fundamental economic reform on social and political life in contemporary China.
