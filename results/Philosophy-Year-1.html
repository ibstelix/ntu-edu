This course is an introduction to selected problems of enduring philosophical importance. We begin by considering whether it can be rational to believe in the existence of God. This discussion is followed by a unit on the possibility, foundations, and limits of human knowledge. The next unit concerns issues in the philosophy of mind. We ask whether or not states of mind?e.g., conscious thoughts, emotions, sensations, etc.- are purely physical states of the brain/body, and nothing more. We also discuss what it means for a person to have an ?identity.? Another unit explores competing perspectives on whether or not human beings have free will. Finally, we study a sampling of topics in moral philosophy, such as skepticism about morality, proposed standards of morally right conduct, and the nature of a just society. Students will learn a variety of concepts developed to clarify these matters. They will also be exposed to diverse philosophical perspectives, including both Western and non-Western approaches. In addition, students will be challenged to articulate wellreasoned answers to the main questions of the course.

This course is an introduction to the basic concepts and techniques of modern logic, as well as applications of logic to classic philosophical problems and paradoxes. Many age-old philosophical problems are deceptively simple but are in fact quite complicated, and we can easily get confused. The first step towards rational and independent thinking is to clear away such confusions. Symbolic logic is a powerful set of techniques that are used by modern philosophers to think clearly about these
problems. The core of the class will consist of a sequence where students are introduced first to modern propositional logic, and then to predicate (first order) logic, using a natural deduction style proof system. Along the way, we will discuss some classic paradoxes such as the liar paradox,
Zeno?s paradox, and Russell?s paradox, as well as applications of logic to philosophical problems such as the ontological argument for the existence of God. Students will acquire concepts and techniques for thinking clearly and independently about these problems, and will then be able to apply
them to a wide range of problems, not just in philosophy.

Morality has always been an important matter in human society, especially
in our multicultural age. What is the nature of morality? What makes an
action right or wrong? How do we think ethically? This course introduces
students to these and related issues. It covers major moral theories with
particular reference to the contemporary world.

This course introduces the canonical thinkers (Descartes, Locke, Spinoza and Hume) in philosophy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course challenges students to think about epistemological and metaphysical questions through these historical thinkers. Key questions include, 'What is the self?' 'What the source of knowledge?' 'Can we know the world as it is?' etc. Particular emphasis will be placed on analyzing arguments from the original text, constructing and evaluating strengths of relevant objections. Students will develop high level critical thinking and writing skills by examining these historical texts and be challenged to think about the richness of philosophical issues that resulted from the new modern science.

This seminar challenges students to think rigorously about morality. The first part of the course explores whether or not moral judgments can be objectively true. Then, we examine several influential philosophical theories of morally right action. Throughout the term, students will be asked to construct and evaluate moral arguments. This will hone the student's ability to reason about issues of moral concern. 

In this module students will learn about the writings of thinkers who lived centuries ago, as well as important works by contemporary philosophers. It will become apparent that intelligent people can disagree about moral issues, and that no one person's moral views are beyond criticism. However, careful study will reveal that some views concerning morality are more credible than others. The student's task will be to evaluate the various perspectives and form a reasoned judgment as to how the central questions of the course should be answered.

The aim of this interdisciplinary course is to engage students from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds to develop an enhanced awareness of knowledge organization and innovation within a globalizing world, in which they are trained to become active leaders in their major of studies. In the past, human societies embedded their knowledge and values in complex interactions of written, pictorial, sculptural and architectural records, oral memories, and performed rituals. These were their media and in these forms we inherited their arts and science. Now, our society is very close to a fully digital access to all information encapsulated in monuments, museums, galleries, libraries, archives and live performances all over the world and in any language. But to distil data into knowledge, a new generation of scholars, artists, and professionals needs to discuss, test, and implement ICT tools and solutions in correlation with 1) the centuries-old results of each single discipline, which contributes to the domain of heritage science (in humanities, social sciences, architecture, life sciences, engineering, and computer sciences) and 2) the technological potential evolution. The object of this course is to contribute to the training of this new generation.

Culture and Conflict is a multi-disciplinary course which explores the relationship between artistic production and social / political disorder. It investigates the basic philosophical notion that art thrives in times of war, and expires in peace, then goes on to question whether art, as a form of social barometer, can actually anticipate conflict as opposed to merely responding to it. The course also observes the extent to which culture (especially that derived from conflict) is used to create specific social identities and contemporary concepts of memory. A range of historically and geographically diverse case studies will be used: the Medieval and Renaissance Mediterranean, the First World War in Europe, the `Troubles? in Northern Ireland in the 1980s, and present day Singapore. Whether we are looking at the anticipation of war through the ballet, or increasingly avant-garde sculpture, or observing medieval multiculturalism through a microscopic examination of a painted surface or a virtual reconstruction of Cypriot architecture, we are consistently looking at the relationship between culture and conflict. The media of exploration will be: art theory, painting, sculpture, ballet, popular / protest music, architecture, multi-media / technology and international law. Suitable site visits within Singapore to compliment the course will be provided as part of the experiential learning and appreciation of the issues covered in the course.
